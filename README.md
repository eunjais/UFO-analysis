Opening the web page via clicking the index.html will lead users to the database. Different filters can be applied to search for specific UFO sightings, which include:
- date / time 
- city
- state
- country
- shape

Simply press enter and the results that match the specified parameters should show.

## Summary:

One drawback to this dataset is that it is severely limited; it is not up to date. 

1. Utilizing some sort of UFO sighting API that gives constant updates might be better to flesh out a dynamic, constantly evolving database. 
2. A feature that is added for users to be able to add their own entry to the database may be beneficial. 
3. Extending UFO sightings from that in the U.S. to international limits may also diversify the database.
